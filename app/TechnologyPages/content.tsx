        description: "Daylun's Vegetable Glue emerged from the need for an eco-friendly alternative to conventional adhesives. Originating from experiences in shoe factories and a commitment to sustainability, we aimed to address the environmental and health concerns associated with traditional glues. Through extensive research and development, our technology arm, 50ul Tech, formulated a two-part organic glue that not only rivals epoxy adhesives in strength and versatility but also offers a safer and greener solution for various applications. By creating a glue that is both effective and environmentally friendly, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future while meeting the demands of modern construction needs.",
