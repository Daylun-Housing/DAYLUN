                content: `At Daylun, our journey towards developing our revolutionary vegetable glue began with a commitment to sustainability, led by our CEO, Arthur Zankowicz. With extensive experience in sustainable product development within the fashion industry, Arthur was committed to creating eco-friendly solutions. While overseeing the production of a sustainable sandal in Asia, he faced a significant challenge: the overwhelming odors from the conventional adhesives used, despite rigorous ventilation. This moment of discomfort sparked a realization that a truly earth-friendly product couldn’t rely on harsh, chemical-laden glues.

                            Determined to find a better solution, Arthur spearheaded the development of an organic adhesive. The result was a vegetable-based glue that not only matched the strength of traditional epoxy but also eliminated harmful fumes and chemicals. Embracing this innovation, Daylun has since expanded the application of our vegetable glue beyond fashion accessories to the housing construction industry, offering a sustainable alternative for builders aiming to reduce chemical use and enhance environmental friendliness in their projects`,
